# simpleHypotenuseCalc
This is a simple program I created to improve my understanding of GitHub.

## How the program works
The user is prompted for the lengths of the two sides via JOptionPane input dialog boxes. The program saves both of these numbers in two variables of datatype double. It then uses the sqrt method of the Math class to calculate the square root of (x\*x + y\*y). This calculation is stored in a third double variable which is shown back to the user via a JOptionPane message dialog box. 

## What I learnt about Git
I learnt how to upload a project using GitBash.

## How I would improve the project
I would add exception handling for when the user does not enter a value.
